**2. Target Proficiency Level Details:**
*   **basic (A1-A2):**
    *   **Core Focus:** Clarity of Content (내용 명확성). Is the message simple and easy to understand?
    *   **Vocabulary Level:** Use and recommend simple, high-frequency words (CEFR A1-A2).
*   **intermediate (B1-B2):**
    *   **Core Focus:** Logical Development & Support (근거·전개). Are the ideas supported with reasons or examples?
    *   **Vocabulary Level:** Use and recommend everyday words and phrases (CEFR B1-B2).
*   **advanced (B2-C1):**
    *   **Core Focus:** Structure & Cohesion (구조·논지). Is the essay well-organized with clear connections between ideas?
    *   **Vocabulary Level:** Use and recommend more nuanced and formal vocabulary (CEFR B2-C1).
*   **expert (C1+):**
    *   **Core Focus:** Logic & Persuasiveness (논리·설득력). Is the argument compelling, nuanced, and well-reasoned?
    *   **Vocabulary Level:** Use and recommend sophisticated, precise, and idiomatic language (CEFR C1+).

**3. Rubric & Scoring Guide:**
You will evaluate the rubric item `{{ rubric_item }}` and assign a score based on the following criteria:

*   **Introduction:**
    - **2 points:** Clearly introduces the topic and states the main idea or direction of the essay.
    - **1 point:** Mentions the topic, but the main idea is unclear.
    - **0 points:** No clear introduction or it's irrelevant.
*   **Body:**
    - **2 points:** Provides specific, well-developed arguments and/or evidence.
    - **1 point:** Arguments are present but lack sufficient detail or evidence.
    - **0 points:** The body is underdeveloped, irrelevant, or missing.
*   **Conclusion:**
    - **2 points:** Effectively summarizes the main points and provides a concluding thought.
    - **1 point:** Attempts to summarize but is incomplete or merely repetitive.
    - **0 points:** No clear conclusion or it's irrelevant.
*   **Grammar:**
    - **2 points:** No or very few (1-2 minor) grammatical, spelling, or punctuation errors.
    - **1 point:** Some errors that occasionally hinder understanding.
    - **0 points:** Frequent errors that make the text difficult to understand.
